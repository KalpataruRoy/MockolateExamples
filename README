I apologize for not being a technical writer...

A project demonstrating usage of mockolate and hamcrest libraries.

Mockolate works by generating classes at execution time.  It uses
as3-commons-bytecode and floxy libraries to do this.

Mockolate provides mocking and stubbing abilities through:
nice(), strict() and partial()

nice() creates a mock object that will not complain if you call things on it that it doesn't expect
strict() will complain if you call something on it that it doesn't expect
partial() will behave as the class normally does unless you set an expectation (use is discouraged)

By default, nice is used when [Mock] metadata is used but others can be used by:
[Mock(type="partial")]
The [Mock] metadata is somewhat of a misnomer, because it is a nice, partial, or strict
that is being created.  mock(something) is not the same as [Mock]something.
[Mock]something is the same as nice(something).

nice or partial must be used with expect()

The only time you want to use strict is if you are testing to see if something is NOT called/used

Expectations can be made on the mocks with:
expect()
mock()
stub()

stub() is exactly the same as mock() except that you cannot verify() a stub

Things to remember:
-cannot mock static, protected or private
-cannot mock anything in the default package
-verify() is implied at the end of every [Test] method when mockolate [Rule] is added to test case class
-if you use arg() with expect() all of the parameters in the expect() must use arg()
	e.g. expect( test.test(1, 2, arg(anything()))) will not work
	instead: expect( test.test(arg(1), arg(2), arg(anything())))
-mockolate can slow down unit tests to some degree, but it is smart enough to only generate a class once, even if it is mocked in many test cases
-autoverify only works on [Mock]s, not nice/strict/partial created in a test
-autoverify can be turned of with [Test(verify="false")]
-expect() cannot be used with a partial or strict, only a nice
-times(x) will not cause verification to fail if the method/getter/setter is called more than
	the expected number of times.  It will simply not match the expectation after the correct
	number of times have been met.  If you are trying to verify that something ONLY happens
	x number of times, you must use a strict or use the test spy method assertThat(obj, received().method("asdf").times(x))


Mockolate documentation can be found at http://mockolate.org/.
A few things on the site are out of date including
-the record and replay method does not require you to call record() or replay()
-expectArg() is deprecated in favor of arg() although both behave the same

Flex unit:
this is the lifecycle for a flexunit test case

execute [BeforeClass]
for every [Test]
	instantiate an instance of the TestCase class
	execute [Rule]s
	execute [Before]
	execute [Test]
	execute [After]
	execute [Rule]s (rule has control of this)
execute [AfterClass]

MockolateRule inserts all the [Mock] decorated properties at the beginning 
and verify() at the end of every [Test]
